Hello! My name is Kurt and I am a developer in the NY area who works mainly with DevOps tooling and Java to create enterprise applications and get them running on the cloud. My current skillset largely consists of development with Java and Python,
Linux servers and shell scripting, and DevOps pipelines with Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions, connecting to services hosted on Azure. I'm currently looking to pick up Go (and maybe Kotlin down the line since I do love working on the JVM) while working
towards the CompTIA A+. Networking+. and Security+ certifications because I find cybersecurity very interesting and would like to open the door to working in that sector in the future.

My cat Raphael should be considered a co-contributor on any work that I do :)
